<<<<Anchors>>>>
This matches a position, not a character
^abc$	start / end of the string
\b \B	word, not-word boundary

^\w+	Matches the beginning of the string, or the beginning of a line if the multiline flag (m) is enabled. This matches a position, not a character.
  <she> sells seashells
\w+$	Matches the end of the string, or the end of a line if the multiline flag (m) is enabled. This matches a position, not a character.
  she sells <seashells>
s\b 	Matches a word boundary position between a word character and non-word character or position (start / end of string). See the word character class (w) for more info.
  she sell<s> seashell<s>
s\B     Matches any position that is not a word boundary. This matches a position, not a character.
  <s>he <s>ells <s>ea<s>hells

<<<<Escaped Characters>>>>
reserved characters
+*?^$\.[]{}()|/  	The following character have special meaning, and must be preceded by a \ (backslash) to represent a literal character:
\. \* \\	escaped special characters
\t \n \r	tab, linefeed, carriage return
\u00A9	unicode escaped ©

Octal escaped character in the form \000. Value must be less than 255 (\377)
\251RegExr is <©>2014

Unicode escaped character in the form \uFFFF
\u00A9 ---> RegExr is <©>2014
extended unicode escape in the form \u{FFFF}.Supports a full range of unicode point escapes with any number of hex digits.

control character escape in the form \cI
<<\cI matches TAB (char code 9).>>
Escaped control character in the form \cZ. This can range from \cA (SOH, char code 1) to \cZ (SUB, char code 26).





************************************************************************************************
<<<<Groups & Lookaround>>>>
capturing group--Groups multiple tokens together and creates a capture group for extracting a substring or using a backreference
(ha)+ -- << hahaha >> << ha >>a << ha >>h!
numeric reference--Matches the results of a capture group. For example \1 matches the results of the first capture group & \3 matches the third.
(\w)a\1 -- <hah> <dad> bad dab <gag> gab

non-capturing group--Groups multiple tokens together without creating a capture group.
(?:ha)+ -- << hahaha >> << ha >>a << ha >>h!

Positive lookahead --Matches a group after the main expression without including it in the result.
\d(?=px) -- 1pt <2>px 3em <4>px

Negative lookahead -- Specifies a group that can not match after the main expression (if it matches, the result is discarded).
\d(?!px) -- <1>pt 2px <3>em 4px
(abc)	capture group
\1	backreference to group #1
(?:abc)	non-capturing group
(?=abc)	positive lookahead
(?!abc)	negative lookahead

<<<<Quantifiers & Alternation>>>>
a* a+ a?	0 or more, 1 or more, 0 or 1
a{5} a{2,}	exactly five, two or more
a{1,3}	between one & three
a+? a{2,}?	match as few as possible
ab|cd	match ab or cd
